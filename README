The world is hard to use. Fixing that might be too ambitious for a Summer of Code project, but we should be able to help people cope. Right now when you have a problem with, say, web.py, there are several things you can do. You can look at the docs and FAQs, but those are rarely up-to-date and sometimes hard to paw through. You can ask your question on the mailing list, but a response will take a while and subscribing to a mailing list just to get one answer is annoying. Or you can ask on IRC, but it's hard to have your question heard through all the chatter and even if it does get answered, the answer isn't stored in a way that's helpful to anyone else.
