    <h3>some quick notes</h3>
    <p>everything in this section will be moved off to an admin panel. there is no sense of users right now, and we'll just put the tasks here, so you can play around with the app</p>
    
    <h3>bugs</h3>
    <p>- if you're creating a new room, you'll need to reload the page after the modal has closed, and you've created the room</p>
